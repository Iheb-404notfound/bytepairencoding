## Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) Tokenizer

This repository contains a simple implementation of the Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizer. BPE is a subword tokenization technique used in natural language processing to efficiently tokenize text into smaller units, enabling better handling of rare and unknown words in various NLP models.

### Features:
- **Customizable Vocabulary Size:** Specify the target vocabulary size for the BPE tokenizer.
- **Efficient Training Process:** Processes input text to learn and apply subword merges based on character pair frequencies.
- **Easy Integration:** Simple and straightforward codebase, ideal for educational purposes or quick integration into NLP projects.

### Usage:
- Clone the repository and use the provided script to train a BPE tokenizer on your text data.
- Customize parameters like vocabulary size to fit your specific use case.
